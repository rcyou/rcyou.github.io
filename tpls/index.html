                        <p>Time to switch to a first-person narrative …</p>
                        <p>Like many others, art &amp; drawing were fundamental in my life. I'd entertain myself for hours daily with paper, crayons, markers, &amp; pencils. Little did I know design or illustration were things anyone could do to make a living.</p>
                        <p>Influenced by cartoons, comic books, &amp; art from Nintendo video game manuals during the 90s, I try to inject a similar sense of energy &amp; fun into my work.</p>
                        <p>When I am not dabbling in a project, I like to go to the gym, spend time with my family, &amp; take weekend trips to Iowa City to watch the Hawkeyes.</p>

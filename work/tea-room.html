      <p class="lede">Rising from the ashes of the 2014 Younkers building fire in downtown Des Moines, the Tea Room is a renovated event space located at 713 Walnut Street. While at Visionary Services, I worked with the marketing and leadership teams at Blackbird Investments and Rutland Rooster Events to create and build a website to promote the revamped venue.</p>

        <h2 class="mini-header">Process</h2>
        <p>As the Tea Room neared the end of itâ€™s interior renovation and restoration, ownership wanted a website that reflected the classic-but-modern look of the new space. They were in the process of finalizing the venue logo with another designer, and were looking to me to expand the concept for use online, which would then help their future marketing team with a direction to follow for printed materials.</p>
        <p>With many stakeholders involved, sketches proved to be the best way to begin discussions about the visual direction for the venue website. This led to more confident, higher fidelity mockups when the time came, and then to interactive prototypes once consensus on the overall look and feel was reached.</p>

    <section class="content">
      <p>Even in the rough concept stages, it was clear the 45-degree angle from the logo would be a unique design element that could provide visual unity and brand familiarity when the logo was not present. The ability to grow and shrink a shape while maintaining the angle was useful for indicating transitions as well since we planned to move users around the site without reloading the page.</p>

    <section class="content">
      <p>This project was one of firsts. I left the website footer small and out of the way, leaving more room for photos and content to showcase the space. I also coded the AJAX requests to load pages in a smooth and dynamic way, as if you were moving around the many rooms of the venue itself.</p>

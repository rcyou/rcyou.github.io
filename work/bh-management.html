      <p class="lede">BH Management is a property management company overseeing nearly 300 apartment communities across 20 states. In an industry heavily reliant on aesthetics and conveniences to attract new residents, BH sought to capitalize on a recent boom in nationwide expansion to redesign its website and match the level of delight and practicality online that it offers at their properties. At Visionary Services, I worked on the interaction design for the new community search interface.</p>

        <p>Through internal team conversations and discussions with BH Management, it was clear that the previous state-based and city-based approaches to searching for an apartment community needed to change. Searching for an apartment isn’t only about checking availability and amenities. That comes later. The first step is figuring out where the building is in a city and what is nearby.</p>
        <p>Before users couldn’t locate a building and then explore how near or far it was from their place of employment, a grocery store, or entertainment districts, among other things.</p>
        <p>Utilizing a mapping API, the development team at Visionary Services implemented a location-based search tool. However, a problem arose when users zoomed in to the street or neighborhood level: information was covered up.</p>

        <p>For desktop users or those with screens larger than a small tablet, the search interface covering up content wasn’t ideal but also wasn’t terrible. However, small-screen mobile users, which accounted for 55% of the site’s traffic at the time, had a bad experience.</p>
        <p>After looking at our development limitations and determining options, we realized it would be better if some things just could get out of the user’s way.</p>

      <p>This tongue-in-cheek request, led me to leveraging event-based interactions within the map to make the obstructing search bar opaque and minimized when a user selected an apartment community. This allowed users to explore what was nearby uninhibited.</p>

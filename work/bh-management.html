      <p class="lede">BH Management is a property management company overseeing nearly 300 apartment communities across 20 states. In an industry heavily reliant on aesthetics and conveniences to attract new residents, BH sought to capitalize on a recent boom in nationwide expansion to redesign its website and match the level of delight and practicality online that it offers at their properties. At Visionary Services, I worked on the interaction design for the new community search interface.</p>

        <h2 class="mini-header">UX Challenges</h2>
        <p>Through internal team conversations and discussions with BH Management, it was clear that the previous state-based and city-based approaches to searching for an apartment community needed to change. Searching for an apartment isn’t just about checking availability and amenities. That comes later. The first step is figuring out where the building is and what is nearby.</p>
        <p>Before users were restricted to filtering communities by state and then by city. This mainly served to structure URLs for improved SEO. However, people don’t search that way. Instead they plug in a city or address and explore what is nearby. People in Kansas City especially found the old process challenging.</p>

        <p>Utilizing a mapping API, the development team at Visionary Services implemented a location-based search tool. To prevent inundating the user with a slew of overlapping pins, we decided to programmatically cluster nearby communities.</p>
        <p>For the UI, I wanted to use something other than color to differentiate clusters – especially since color could accidently create bias and disturb visual balance as the map changed. Even though there would be a number in the middle of a cluster to indicate how many communities it represented, I opted for size and opacity.</p>
        <p>This helped correlate the size of a point with the number of communities in its radius and worked with the zoom level our developers put in place as users further explored a cluster.</p>

      <p>For desktop users or those with screens larger than a small tablet, we were able to display a list of communities located within the current map view next to the map that had pin markers.</p>
      <p>However, small-screen mobile users, which accounted for 55% of the site’s traffic at the time, had a really long screen of content with the map and communities list stacked above one another. Instead, it was important to make the mobile experience feel organic and almost like using a native app.</p>
      <p>After looking at our development limitations and determining options, this led me to leveraging event-based interactions to toggle different screens. This allowed users to choose their experience. They could explore without being inhibited and view a list of results on demand.</p>

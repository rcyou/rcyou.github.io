      <p class="lede">The Ananias Foundation is a nonprofit with roots in Des Moines, Iowa working to stop domestic violence through behavioral change. To help put people on the path to reform, the foundation connects men and women who have committed acts of domestic violence with online resources that explain how to stop.</p>

      <p>The subject matter for this project was completely foreign to me. However, the challenge increased my awareness of domestic violence and the havoc it creates for victims and families. Before, I never knew that as much as 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men in the United States have experienced severe physical violence by their partner, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/summaryreports.html" target="_blank" title="2011 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, Summary & Special Reports">according to a CDC study released in 2011.</a></p>

        <p>The founder of the Ananias Foundation came to me with a few loose ideas he'd been thinking about for some time. These ideas revolved around stepping into light and someone becoming whole again. There was also the story behind the organization’s namesake - a biblical tale of a man who restored the sight of another man who would later become the disciple Paul. While seemingly vague, these concepts proved to be wonderful themes to explore during the early sketching phase.</p>

        <p>After many drawings and a couple rounds of revisions, it became clear that light and sight were the strongest motifs. They also yielded the most flexible visuals that could be transposed to form an initial. This helped make the logo less abstract and more relatable while also serving as a symbol of the organization’s values.</p>

      <p>Using my research and a couple key themes as my boundaries, I created a logo that could be used large and small online and in the real world. The circle represents community, while the triangle stands for the holy trinity. Inside the triangle is a flame, which evokes the dark to light transformation, and the resulting negative space creates a letter A.</p>

      <p class="lede">In short, Bliss is like Uber for event staffing in Iowa. Primarily focusing on weddings and private events, Bliss manages a few dozen subcontractors around the state who sign up to work as kitchen help, bartenders, wait staff, or other various positions as assigned. At Visionary Services, I am working on a new mobile web application for Bliss to manage staff and staffing requests, designing the UX process flows and creating the UI.</p>

        <h2 class="mini-header">UX Challenges</h2>
        <p>Staffing is run through one person at Bliss, generally initiated via text message or email and then managed in a series of Google docs. Since the subcontractors are used to direct communication, there needed to be a way to continue that direct contact but also automate the process. In turn, the experience of using a new tool needs to feel natural for workers being asked to change their processes.</p>

        <h2 class="mini-header">Process</h2>
        <p> With limited visible screen real estate on mobile, prioritization of content was my first step in designing the app interface. Low-fidelity, grayscale wireframes were my tool of choice since it allowed me to focus on visual hierarchy and affordance right away. I also wanted to be able to print out the screens to test font size and readability since certain interactions and prompts would have limited but important content.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="content split-content">
      <span class="col">
        <p>After establishing a baseline with just a few screens, I went back to hashing out the process flow and understanding what the key user actions were: accepting a job, declining a job, and viewing a job but no accepting or declining. To me, it was important to let users decide their schedule because they are subcontractors. Otherwise, they should just be assigned a job.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="col">
        <p>I also looked at where a user could potentially veer off, listed possible reasons or scenarios, and presented the options for my team to determine if some routes could be closed.Meanwhile, I created more of the key wireframes and did a combination of paper prototyping and user testing to check my design assumptions with others in the office.</p>

    <section class="content">
      <p>To keep our client looped into the process, I started creating high-fidelity mockups to provide a sense of visual direction for the app, which will coincide with the redesign for the Bliss marketing website where staffing requests will start.</p>

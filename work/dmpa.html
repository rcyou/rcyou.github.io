      <p class="lede">Following the announcement of “Hamilton,” the musical, as part of its 2017-2018 season ticket package, Des Moines Performing Arts identified an opportunity to refocus the visual direction of its brand. While at Visionary Services, I set out to truly design a web system for the new DMPA website.</p>

        <p>Events were the first thing my team and I tackled since they are the main traffic driver and money maker. There were a few different event types, and even the main performances had subtle variations.</p>
        <p>This led me to taking an object-oriented UX approach where I identified attributes shared by all events and then explored those that distinguished one event type from another. This helped stakeholders agree early on about what was needed when creating and managing events, and guided our development team in identifying which pieces were reusable or made up of other components.</p>

        <p>Events were also a big component of the UI. Not only would there be a main list of upcoming events, DMPA wanted to showcase related events, promote certain events over others, and display events on key content pages. While the method of including events on a page would be different, it was important to not confuse users and keep the look identical. This allowed events to accentuate the main content without being invasive and maintain visual consistency.</p>

        <p>It was also important to make it easier for users to search for events. Venue, genre, and date were primary attributes we uncovered in the early UX research. Series proved to be a secondary but important characteristic we discovered users were also utilizing to filter events.</p>

    <section class="content">
      <p>Knowing the DMPA website would include a lot of moving pieces helped me establish my design process early. Nearly all pages would be built from myriad components, so mockups were only useful up to a certain point for approval on the visual direction from stakeholders. This allowed the design to evolve during the course of the project as new requirements or restrictions were uncovered. Without this approach, the overall system would have become too rigid while additional information was being uncovered.</p>
